# Consider the following algorithm. The input is a connected undirected graph with edge costs (distinct, if you prefer). The algorithm works in iterations. If the current graph forms a spanning tree, the algorithm stops. Otherwise, it selects an arbitrary cycle from the current graph and removes the highest-cost edge within the cycle. Is there an assurance that this algorithm will always produce a minimum-cost spanning tree? Demonstrate with either a proof or a counterexample.
