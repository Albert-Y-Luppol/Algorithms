# Consider a connected undirected graph G with not necessarily distinct edge costs. Suppose there are two different minimum-cost spanning trees, denoted as T and T'. Is there necessarily a sequence of minimum-cost spanning trees T_0, T_1, T_2, ..., T_r = T' such that each consecutive pair T_i, T_{i+1} of MSTs differs by only a single edge swap? Prove the statement or exhibit a counterexample.
